## Instructions

The code is written with modularity in mind. The filename convention is the following:
- `run_*.py` - run the simulations
- `node.py` - implements a fog/edge node
- `log.py` - logging utilities
- `service_*.py` - implements the services used during the simulations
- `plot_*.py` - plot results
