  based on Reinforcement Learning"
description: This study addresses the complex problem of task scheduling and battery
  management within the context of the Edge-to-Cloud continuum. Our proposed approach
  incorporates multi-objective optimization, which encompasses power management in
  addition to real-time processing demands, to ensure both performance and sustainability.
  Our methodology takes into account the heterogeneity of nodes and dynamically organizes
  jobs to meet user-specified processing requirements. This is achieved through the
  utilization of online Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning technique that
  enables the system to learn and adapt to the dynamic environment in real-time.
